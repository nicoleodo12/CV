                <p><em>Occupational Therapist and Web Development Student</em></p>
                <p2>I have been an Occupational Therapist for over 4 years. I received my Master's in Occupational Therapy from Chatham University in 2018. I have enjoyed helping people gain independence with their daily tasks including helping them access technology and computers using adaptive techniques and adaptive equipment/programs. I am excited to begin my journey in learing the ins and outs of web development and I hope to one day combine my OT and coding knowledge to help increase access to the internet for people with disabilities.</p2>
